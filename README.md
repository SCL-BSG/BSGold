# BSGold
Bank Society Gold, BSGold coin is a next generation coin with Proof of Work and Proof of Stake with 
Smart Contracts planned for a future roadmap.

Proof of Stake with Masternode reward system, all coins are staked in the users wallet, where Masternodes
provide a verification/validation system and take a percentage of the users staked coin.
The key concept here is different from Ethereum validators, as a Masternode can only acheve rewards
if it's active and does not lock coins of the users, as users coins are staked in their decentralised
wallets. All staking or minting rewards must be validated by the network to ensure the stake of coins is 
a successful mint on the Bank Society Gold network. eg the stake mints a new valid block on the blockchain.

Rewards are very light with Bank Society Coin, but much better that the existing Bank savings account rewards.
